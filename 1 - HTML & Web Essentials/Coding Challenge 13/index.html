      Challenge: Design and code the user interface (UI) for a web application that will offer a different design, layout and function from that traditional website. Try to create something that is in the context of a "web application" not a "web site" such as a stock trading application, a banking application, a media streaming or a gaming application using HTML and CSS, ensuring optimization for both web and mobile platforms.
      Requirements: Create a comprehensive UI layout with a variety of HTML elements such as buttons, dropdown menus, input fields, tables, charts, and navigation bars to facilitate user interaction and control various aspects of the stock trading application. Pay close attention to responsive design principles to ensure optimal display and usability across different screen sizes and devices. Emphasize consistency in look and feel between the web and mobile app versions while considering the unique user experience requirements of each platform. Incorporate mobile-friendly design patterns, such as touch-friendly controls and intuitive navigation, to enhance usability on mobile devices. Test the web and mobile app designs thoroughly to ensure seamless functionality and user experience across different platforms and devices.'
