              Python is a popular programming language created in 1991 by Guido
              van Rossum.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive,
              object-oriented, and high-level programming languago.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is a dynamically typed and garbage-collected programming
              language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985-1990.

            <li>
              Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU
              General Public License (GPL).
            </li>

            <li>
              Python is Interpreted- Python is processed at runtime by the
              interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before
              executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is Interactive- You can actually sit at a Python prompt and
              interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is Object-Oriented- Python supports Object-Oriented style
              or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
